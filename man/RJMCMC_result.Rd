\title{Nucleosomes obtained by running RJMCMC function
(for demo purpose).}
\format{A \code{list} of \code{class} "rjmcmcNucleosomes" containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{call} the matched call.
\item \code{k} a \code{integer}, the final estimation of the number
of nucleosomes. \code{0} when no nucleosome is detected.
\item \code{mu} a \code{vector} of \code{numeric} of length
\code{k}, the positions of the nucleosomes. \code{NA} when no nucleosome is
detected.
\item \code{k_max} a \code{integer}, the maximum number of nucleosomes
obtained during the iteration process. \code{NA} when no nucleosome is
detected.
