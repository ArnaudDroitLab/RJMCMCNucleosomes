==============================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adeschen/RJMCMCNucleosomes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adeschen/RJMCMCNucleosomes)

# THIS PACKAGE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AT THIS MOMENT #

This package uses informative Multinomial-Dirichlet prior in a t-mixture with 
reversible jump estimation of nucleosome positions for genome-wide profiling.

This package is in R with an optimized section in C++
